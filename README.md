# Python Notes

### Introduction
- Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively.
–	Python is an easy to learn,
–	very clear, readable syntax
–	exception-based error handling
–	very high level dynamic data types
- It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming.
- Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
- Python can be integrated with another language.
- Python runs everywhere.
- It can be downloaded from http://www.python.org/download

### Arithmetic Operators
- Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations.
- There are 7 arithmetic operators in Python :
  - Addition - It is used to add 2 values('+')
  - Subtraction - It is used to subtract the second value from the first value('-')
  - Multiplication - It is used to find the product of 2 values('*')
  - Division - It is used to find the quotient when first operand is divided by the second('/')
  - Modulus - It is used to find the remainder when first operand is divided by the second('%')
  - Exponentiation - It is used to raise the first operand to power of second('**')
  - Floor division - It is used to raise the first operand to power of second('//')

### Comparison Operators
- Comparison Operators are used for comparing the values. It either returns True or False according to the condition. These operators are also known as Relational operators.

### Bitwise Operators
-  Bitwise operators are used to performing bitwise calculations on integers. The integers are first converted into binary and then operations are performed on bit by bit, hence the name bitwise operators

### Assigment Operators
- Assignment Operators are used to assigning values to variables.

### Logical Operators
- In Python, Logical operators are used on conditional statements (either True or False). They perform Logical AND, Logical OR and Logical NOT operations.

### Membership Operators
- Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:

### Operators Precedence

- The following table lists all operators from highest precedence to lowest.
